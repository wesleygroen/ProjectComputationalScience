1) all functions up to now seem bug free, no need to work further on them

2) expand functionality: 2 lanes,
			 stop signs,
			 speed randomization, 
			 error measurement,
			 
3) wesley, sebas: continue work on efficient animations

4) make the mathematical model, 
	argue analytical solutions, 
	define hypothesis resolution criteria (i.e. error measure deltas)
